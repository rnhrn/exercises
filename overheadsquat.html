                Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, placing the resistance band under both feet and holding the handles at shoulder height (video shows above shoulders, either works).
            </li>
            <li>
                Lower yourself into a squat position, keeping your back straight and chest up, until your thighs are parallel to the ground.
            </li>
            <li>
                Push through your heels to return to the starting position. Repeat for 3 sets of 10-12 reps.
